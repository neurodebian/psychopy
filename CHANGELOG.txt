!!Version numbers
In general, when a new feature is added the first or the second number is incremented (e.g. 0.90.3 -> 0.91.0). Those releases might break previous code you've written because new features often need slight changes to other things. 
Changes to the final digit (0.92.1 -> 0.92.2) implies a bug-fixing release or very minor new features that shouldn't require code changes form the user.

!!Changelog 

PsychoPY 0.96.01:
* FIXED problem with write errors running demos from Mac IDE
* ADDED frameWidth to textStim for multiline
* ADDED setRecordFrameIntervals, saveFrameTimes() to Window and misc.plotFrameIntervals()
* FIXED movie is currently affected by texture color

!!!PsychoPY 0.96.0:
* FIXED pygame back-end so that can be used as a valid alternative to pyglet (requires pygame1.8+ and PyOpenGL3.0+, both included in mac app)

PsychoPY 0.96.0:
* CHANGED default sound handler to be pygame again. Although pyglet looked promising for this
  it has turned out to be buggy. Timing of sounds can be very irregular and sometimes they don't even play
  Although pygame has longer overall latencies (20-30ms) it's behaviour is at least robust. This will be 
  revisited one day when i have time to write driver-specific code for sounds
* FIXED image importing - scaling from square image wasn't working and CMYK images weren't imported
  properly. Both are now fine.

PsychoPy 0.95.11:
* ADDED sound.Sound.getDuration() method
* FIXED spurious (unimportant but ugly) error messages raised by certain threads on core.quit()

PsychoPy 0.95.9:
* FIXED further bug in sound.Sound on win32 (caused by thread being polled too frequently)
* FIXED new bug in notebook view (introduced in 0.95.8)

PsychoPy 0.95.8:
* FIXED bug in sound.Sound not repeating when play() is called repeatedly
* IDE uses improved notebook view for code pages
* IDE line number column is larger
* IDE SaveAs no longer raises (inconsequential) error
* IDE Cmd-S or Ctrl-S now clears autocomplete
    
PsychoPy 0.95.7:
* ADDED misc.cart2pol()
* ADDED highly optimised ElementArrayStim, suitable for drawing large numbers of elements. Requires fast OpenGL 2.0 gfx card - at least an nVidia 8000 series or ATI HD 2600 are recommended.
* FIXED bug in calibTools with MonitorFolder (should have been monitorFolder)
* FIXED bug in Sound.stop() for pyglet contexts
* FIXED bug in running scripts with spaces in the filename/path (Mac OS X)

PsychoPy 0.95.6:
* DISABLED the setting of gamma if this is [1,1,1] (allows the user to set it from a control
 panel and not have this adjusted)
* FIXED gamma setting on linux (thanks to Luca Citi for testing)
* FIXED bug in TextStim.setRGB (wasn't setting properly after text had been created)
* FIXED bug searching for shaders on ATI graphics cards
* FIXED - now no need to download avbin for the mac IDE installation

PsychoPy 0.95.5:
* FIXED bug in event.clearEvents() implementation in pyglet (wasn't clearing)
* FIXED - psychopy no longer disables ipython shortcut keys
* FIXED bug in sound.Sound initialisation without pygame installeds
* ADDED core.rush() for increasing thread priority on win32
* ADDED Window._haveShaders, XXXStim._useShaders and XXXStim.setUseShaders
* FIXED crashes on win32, running a pyglet context after a DlgFromDict
* ADDED gamma correction for pyglet contexts (not tested yet on linux)

PsychoPy 0.95.4:
* CHANGED PsychoPy options (IDE and monitors) now stored the following, rather than with the app. (monitor calib files will be moved here if possible)
    * ~/.PsychoPy/IDE (OS X, linux)
    * <Docs and Settings>/<user>/Application Data/PsychoPy
* FIXED bug in text rendering (ATI/win32/pyglet combo only)
* FIXED minor bug in handling of images with alpha channel

PsychoPy 0.95.3:
* ADDED a .clearTextures() method to PatchStim and RadialStim, which should be 
called before de-referencing a stimulus
* CHANGED input range for numpy array textures to -1:1
* ADDED sysInfo.py to demos

PsychoPy 0.95.2:
* FIXED quitting PsychoPyIDE now correctly cancels when saving files

PsychoPy 0.95.1:
* FIXED problem with saving files from the IDE on Mac
* FIXED Cmd-C now copies from the output window of IDE
* even nicer IDE icons (thanks to the Crystal project at everaldo.com)
* FIXED bug in the shaders code under pyglet (was working fine in pygame already)
* (refactored code to use a template visual stimulus)

!!!PsychoPy 0.95.0:
* FIXED linux bug preventing repeated dialogs (thanks Luca Citi)
* REWRITTEN stimuli to use _BaseClass, defining ._set() method
* MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS to IDE:
  * Intel mac version available as app bundle, including python
  * FIXED double help menu 
  * cleaned code for fetching icons
  * fixed code for updating SourceAssistant (now runs from .OnIdle())

!!!PsychoPy 0.94.0:
* pyglet:
  * can use multiple windows and multiple screens (see screensAndWindows demo)
  * sounds are buffered faster and more precisely (16ms with <0.1ms variability on my system)
  * creating sounds in pyglet starts a separate thread. If you use sounds in your script you must call core.quit() when you're done to exit the system (or this background thread will continue).
  * pyglet window.setGamma and setGammaRamp working on win and mac (NOT LINUX)
  * pyglet event.Mouse complete (and supports wheel as well as buttons)
  * pyglet is now the default context. pygame will be used if explicitly called or if pyglet (v1.1+) isn't found
  * pyglet can now get/save movie frames (like pygame)
  * TextStims are much cleaner (and a bit bigger?) Can use multiple lines too. New method for specifying font 
* added simpler parallel.py (wraps _parallel which will remain for now)
* removed the C code extensions in favour of ctypes (so compiler no longer necessary)
* converted "is" for "==" where appropriate (thanks Luca)
* Window.getMovieFrame now takes a buffer argument ('front' or 'back')
* monitor calibration files now stored in HOME/.psychopy/monitors rather than site-packages
* Window.flip() added and supports the option not to clear previous buffer (for incremental drawing). Window.update() is still available for now but can be replaced with flip() commands 
* updated demos

PsychoPy 0.93.6:
* bug fixes for OS X 10.5 and ctypes OpenGL
* new improved OS X installer for dependencies
* moved to egg for OS X distribution

PsychoPy 0.93.5:
* added rich text ctrl to IDE output, including links to lines of errors
* IDE now only opens one copy of a given text file
* improved (chances of) sync-to-vertical blank on windows without adjusting driver settings
(on windows it's still better to set driver to force sync to be safe!)
* added center and radius arguments to filters.makeMask and filters.makeRadialMatrix
* implemented pyglet backend for;
-> -better screen handling (can specify which screen a window should appear in)
-> -fewer dependencies (takes care of pygame and opengl)
-> -faster sound production
-> -TextStims can be multi-line
-> -NO GAMMA-SETTING as yet. Don't use this backend if you need a gamma-corrected window and aren't using Bits++.
* changed the behaviour of Window winTypes
If you leave winType as None PsychoPy tries to use Pygame, Pyglet, GLUT in that order 
(when Pyglet can handle gamma funcs it will become default). Can be overridden by specifying winType.
* turned off depth testing for drawing of text (will simply be overlaid in the order called) 
* changes to TextStim: pyglet fonts are loaded by name only, not filename. PsychoPy TextStim now has an
additional argument called 'fontFiles=[]' to allow the adding of custom ttf fonts, but the font name should be used
as the font=" " argument.    
* updated some of the Reference docs

PsychoPy 0.93.3:
* fixed problem with 'dynamic loading of multitextureARB' (only found on certain graphics cards)

PsychoPy 0.93.2:
* improved detection of non-OpenGL2.0 drivers

PsychoPy 0.93.1:
* now automatically uses shaders only if available (older machines can use this version but will not benefit from the speed up)
* slight speed improvement for TextStim rendering (on all machines)

!!!PsychoPy 0.93.0:
* new requirement of PyOpenGL3.0+ (and a graphics card with OpenGL2.0 drivers?)
* much faster implementation of setRGB, setContrast and setOpacity (using fragment shaders)
* images (and other textures) need not be square. They will be automatically resampled if they arent. Square power-of-two image textures are still recommended
* Fixed problem in calibTools.DACrange caused by change in numpy rounding behaviour. (symptom was strange choice of lum values for calibrations)
* numpy arrays as textures currently need to be NxM intensity arrays
* multitexturing now handled by OpenGL2.0 rather than ARB
* added support for Cedrus response pad
* if any component of rgb*contrast>1 then the stimulus will be drawn as low contrast and b/y (rgb=[0.2,0.2,-0.2]) in an attempt to alert the user that this is out of range

PsychoPy 0.92.5:
* Fixed issue with stairhandler (it was terminating based only on the nTrials). It does now terminate when both the nTrials and the nReversals [or length(stepSizes) if this is greater] are exceeded.
* Minor enhancements to IDE (added explicit handlers to menus for Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-Y, Ctrl-D)

PsychoPy 0.92.4:
* fixed some source packaging problems for linux (removed trademark symbols from serialposix.py and fixed directory capitalisation of IDE/Resources in setup.py). Thanks to Jason Locklin and Samuele Carcagno for picking them up.
* numerous minor improvements to the IDE
* reduced the buffer size of sound stream to reduce latency of sound play
* fixed error installing start menu links (win32)

PsychoPy 0.92.3:
* new source .zip package (switched away from the use of setuptools - it didn't include files properly in a source dist)
* Fixed problem on very fast computers that meant error messages weren't always displayed in the IDE

PsychoPy 0.92.2:
* have been trying (and failing) to make scripts run faster from the IDE under Mac OS X. Have tried using threads and debug modules (which would mean you didn't need to import all the libs every time). All these work fine under win32 but not under OS X every time :-( If anyone has a new idea for how to run a pygame window in the same process as the IDE thread I'd love hear it!!!
* removed the messages from the new TextStim stimuli 
* fixed bug in IDE that caused it to crash before starting if pythonw.exe was run rather than python.exe on first run(!)
* improvements to the source assistant window (better help and now fetches function arguments)
Known Problems:
* The IDE isn't collecting all errors that are returned - a problem with the process redirection mechanism? FIXED in 0.92.3

PsychoPy 0.92.1
* fixed minor bug in IDE - wouldn't open if it had been closed with no open docs.
* fixed problem with pushing/popping matrix that caused the stimuli to disappear (only if a TextStim was rendered repeatedly)

'''PsychoPy 0.92.0:'''
* 'sequential' ordering now implemented for data.TrialHandler (thx Ben Webb)
* moved to pygame fonts (with unicode support and any TT font onthe system). The switch will break any code that was using TextStim with lineWidth or letterWidth as args. Users wanting to continue using the previous TextStim can call textStimGLUT instead (although I think the new pygame fonts are superior in every way).
* improved IDE handling of previous size (to cope with being closed in the maximised or minimised state, which previously caused the window not to return)
  
PsychoPy 0.91.5
* fixed minor bug in using numpy.array as a mask (was only working if array was 128x128)
* faster startup for IDE (added threading class for importing modules)
* fixed very minor bug in IDE when searching for attributes that dont exist
* fixed minor bug where scripts with syntax errors didn't run but didn't complain either
* IDE FileOpen now tries the folder that the current file is in first
* IDE removed threading class for running scripts

PsychoPy 0.91.4
* fixed the problem of stimulus order/depth. Now the default depth is set (more intuitively) by the order of drawing not creating.
* IDE added recent files to file menu
* IDE minor bug fixes
* IDE rewrite of code inspection using wx.py.instrospect

PsychoPy 0.91.3
* added find dialog to IDE
* added ability of data.FunctionFromStaircase to create unique bins rather than averaging several x values. Give bins='unique' (rather than bins=someInteger). Also fixed very minor issue where this func would only take a list of lists, rather than a single list. 

PsychoPy 0.91.2
* fixed IDE problem running filenames containing spaces (only necessary on win32)

PsychoPy 0.91.1
* added reasonable SourceAssistant to IDE
* added a stop button to abort scripts in IDE
* IDE scripts now run as sub process rather than within the main process: slower but safer
* added an autoflushing stdout to psychopy.__init__. Where lots of text is written to stdout this may be a problem, but turing it off means that stdout doesn't get properly picked up by the IDE :-(

'''PsychoPy 0.91.0'''
* PsychoPy now has its own IDE!! With syntax-highlighting, code-folding and auto-complete!! :-)
* gui.py had to be refactored a little but (I think) should not be noticed by the end user (gui.Dlg is now a subclass of wx.Dialog rather than a modified instance)
* gui.Dlg and DlgFromDict now end up with an attribute .OK that is either True or False 
* fixed bug in data.StairHandler that could result in too many trials being run (since v0.89)

PsychoPy 0.90.4
* resolved deprecation warning with wxPython (now using "import wx")

PsychoPy 0.90.3
* used the new numpy.mgrid commands throughout filters and visual modules
* sorted out the rounding probs on RadialStim
* fixed import bug in calibtools.py

PsychoPy 0.90.2
* fixed new bug in the minVal/maxVal handling of StairHandler (where these have not been specified)
* changed the default console log level to be ERROR, due to too much log output! 

PsychoPy 0.90.1
* fixed new bug in Sound object
* changed the default log file to go to the script directory rather than site-packages/psychopy

'''PsychoPy 0.90'''
* sounds now in stereo and a new function to allow you to choose the settings for the
 sound system.
* LMS colours (cone-isolating stimuli) are now tested and accurate (when calibrated)
* added logging module (erros, warnings, info). And removed other messages:
     * "Verbose" flags have become log.info messages
     * "Warn" commands have become log.warning messages
* added minVal and maxVal arguments to data.StairHandler so that range can be bounded
* "import psychopy" no longer imports anything other than core

Psychopy 0.89.1
* fixed bug in new numpy's handling of bits++ header

Psychopy 0.89
* optimised DotStim to use vertex arrays (can now draw several thousand dots)
* optimised RadialStim to use vertex arrays (can increase radial resolution without much loss)

Psychopy 0.88
* fixed problem with MonitorCenter on OSX (buttons not working on recent version of wxPython)

Psychopy 0.87
* added sqrXsqr to RadialStim and made it default texture
* fixed a minor bug in RadialStim rendering (stimuli failed to appear under certain stimulus orderings)
* changed RadialStim size parameter to be diameter rather than radius (to be like AlphaStim)
* namechange: introduced PatchStim (currently identical to AlphaStim which may one day become deprecated)

Psychopy 0.86
* distributed as an .egg

Psychopy 0.85
*upgraded for numpy1.0b and scipy0.50. Hopefully those packages are now stable enough that
 they won't need further PsychoPy compatibility changes

Psychopy 0.84
*NEW (alpha) support for radial patterns rather than linear ones
*changed Clock behaviour to use time.clock() on win32 rather than time.time()
*fixed a bug in the shuffle seeding behaviour
*added a noise pattern to bacground in monitor calibration

Psychopy 0.83
*NEW post-install script for Win32 installs shortcuts to your >>Start>Programs menu
*NEW parallel port code (temporary form) using DLportIO.dll can be found under _parallel
*NEW hardware module with support for fORP response box (for MRI) using serial port
*added iterator functionality to data.TrialHandler and data.StairHandler you can now use 
for thisTrial in allTrials:
but aconsequence was that .nextTrial() will be deprecated in favour of .next(). 
Also, when the end of the trials is reached a StopIteration is raised.
*added the ability to seed the shuffle mechanism (and trial handler) so you can repeat 
 experiments with the same trial sequence

Psychopy 0.82
*rewritten code for bits++ LUT drawing, raised by changes in pyOpenGL(2.0.1.09) call to drawpixels
*minor change to exit behaviour. pyGame.quit() is now called and then sys.exit(0) rather than sys.exit(1)
*bug fixes in type handling (from Numeric to numpy)

Psychopy 0.81
*changes to gui caused by new threading behaviour of wxPython and PyGame
 (DlgFromDict must now be a class not a function).

Psychopy 0.80
*switching numeric code to new python24 and new scipy/numpy. MUCH nicer
*new (reduced requirements):
numpy 0.9 or newer (the replacement for Numeric/numarray)
numpy 0.4.4 or newer
pyOpenGL
pygame
PIL
matplotlib (for data plotting)

PsychoPy 0.72
*tested (and fixed) compatibility with wxPython 2.6. Will now be using this as my primary
 handler for GUIs
*ADDED ability to quit during run of getLumSeries

PsychoPy 0.71
*FIXED filename bug in makeMovies.makeAnimatedGIF
*slight change to monitors that it uses testMonitor.calib as a default rather than default.calib
 (testMonitor.calib is packaged with the installation)

PsychoPy 0.70
*FIXED bug in setSize. Wasn't updating correctly
*ADDED ability to append to a data file rather than create new
*bits.lib (from CRS) is now distributed directly with psychopy rather than needing separate install)
*ADDED db/log/linear step methods to StairHandler
*ADDED logistic equation to data.FitFunction

PsychoPy 0.69
*ADDED a testMonitor to the monitors package so that demos can use it for pseudo*calibrated stimuli.
*REDUCED the attempt to use _bits.pyd. Was only necessary for machines that had bits++ monitor center
*ADDED basic staircase method
*CHANGED dlgFromDict to return None on cancel rather than 0
*CHANGED the description of sin textures so that the centre of the patch had the color of dkl or rgb rather
  than the edge. (Effectively all sin textures are now shifted in phase by pi radians).
  -Demos removed from the main package - now ONLY distributed as a separate library

PsychoPy 0.68
*FIXED toFile and fromFile so they work!?
*Demos being distributed as a separate .zip file (may be removed from the main package someday)

PsychoPy 0.67
*ADDED toFile, fromFile, pol2cart functions to psychopy.misc
*CHANGED waitKeys to return a list of keys (usually of length one)
so that it's compatible with getKeys

PsychoPy 0.66
*serial is now a subpackage of psychopy and so doesn't need additional installation
*REMOVED the code to try and query the graphics card about the scr dimensions.
From now on, if yo uwish to use real world units, you MUST specify scrWidthPIX and
scrWidthCM when you make your visual.Window
*ADDED flag to data output to output matrixOnly (useful for matlab imports)
*REVERTED the default numeric handler to be Numeric rather than numarray (because
it looks like numarray hasn't taken off as much as thought)
*FIXED minor bug in text formatting for TrialHandler.saveAsText()
*CHANGED visual.Window so that the monitor argument prefers to receive a Monitor object
(rather than just a dictionary) or just the name of one. MonitorCenter makes it so easy to create these now that 
they should be the default.
*CHANGED Photometer initialisation behaviour - used to raise an error on a fail but now sets an internal attribute .OK to 
False rather than True

PsychoPy 0.65
*MonitorCenter now complete. Plots and checks gamma correction.
*can write movies out to animated gifs(any platform) or mpg/avi (both windows only)

PsychoPy 0.64
*ChANGED monitor key dkl_rgb_matrix to dkl_rgb (also for lms)
*ADDED code for PR650 to get the monitor color calibration and calculate
 the color conversion matrices automatically. Will be implemented via the 
 MonitorCenter application.
*ADDED pyserial2.0 as a subpackage of psychopy so that it needn't be separately installed
*Much improved MonitorCenter with DKL and LMS calibration buttons and matrix output
*Double-click installer for Mac now available

PsychoPy 0.63
*ADDED ability to capture frames from the window as images (tif, jpg...) or
as animated GIF files :) see demo
*ADDED ability for elements in DotStim to be any arbitrary stimulus with a
methods for .setPos(), .draw()

PsychoPy 0.62
*FIXED the circular mask for DotStim
*FIXED bug in the new text alignment method (was being aligned but not positioned?!)

PsychoPy 0.61
*FIXED minor bug in MonitorCenter (OS X only)

*PsychoPy 0.60*
*ADDED a GUI application for looking after monitors and calibrations.
SEE MonitorCenter.py in the new package monitors
*MOVED "psychopy.calib" subpackage to a whole separate package "monitors".
Calibration files will now be stored alongside the calibration code. This makes 
it easier to develop the new calibration GUI application that I'm working on.
Also means that if you delete the psychopy folder for a new installation you 
won't lose your calibration files.
*ADDED optional maxWait argument to event.waitKeys()
*CHANGED TextStim to take the font as a name rather than font number
*ADDED alignment to text stimuli (alignVert, alignHoriz)
*CHANGED waitKeys to implicitly clear keys from the event queue so that it
only finds the first keypress after its called. As result it now returns a single 
character rather than list of them
*CHANGED visual.Window so that it no longer overrides monitor settings if arguments
are specified. Easy now to create a monitor in the monitors GUI and use that instead
*ADDED the circular mask for DotStimulus

PsychoPy 0.53
*FIXED minor bug in the filter module that resulted from the switch to numarray 
from Numeric

PsychoPy 0.52
*ADDED support for cone contrast space (LMS) and cone-opponents space (DKL) to
AlphaStim (requires a conversion matrix - now need to write the calibration code
to create those!)

PsychoPy 0.51
-SWITCHED to numarray from Numeric as the default. If numarray isn't found
Numeric will be used instead (but that may not always be supported)
-ADDED bootstrapping to data module (pure python implementation, so a bit
slow but working!)
-REMOVED support for slow updating of bits++ CLUT because fast one works fine!
(could be added again later if necess)

PsychoPy 0.14
-ADDED rgbPedestal property to AlphaStim
-ADDED ability to use numarray arrays as textures
-FIXED import of bits++ module so that people without one can still use PsychoPy!
-ADDED Weibull and Cumulative Normal (erf) fitting to data module (requries scipy)

PsychoPy 0.13
-**TESTED on MacOS X (10.3.3, 10.3.4)**
        required some minor changes to what was imported (numpy is 
        not easily accessible on Mac etc...). Most things work (except
        for curve fitting) if you download the appropriate libraries.
        Install with
        > sudo pythonw setup.py install
-ADDED ability to many visual stimuli for changes to be made using
        e.g.: myStim.setContrast(1.0)#(better for people with autocomplete)
        rather than
        myStim.set('contrast',1.0)
-ADDED window positioning on the screen defaults to same as before
(requires SDL 1.27 or above on windows)
Should allow the use of secondary monitor?
-ADDED sound module to allow the playing of simple sounds (tones
created on the fly or other sounds loaded from wav files)
-FIXED bug where text colors and texture colors were interacting if 
text was created first.
-MOVED handlers for data and trials into a separate sub-module 
(was in core). They need to be somewhere that pygame isn't
imported for pickling reasons(?).

PsychoPy 0.12
-ADDED bits++ integration

PsychoPy 0.11
-ADDED code to build simple dialogues for subject input 
(requires wxPython)
-ADDED Window now optionally receives a Monitor object
(calib.Monitor) for gamma and size settings. These
settings are then overridden if user supplies values.
-ADDED quit() to the core psychopy, aiding graceful quitting
-CHANGED units of stimulus objects now default to the units 
of the Window being used (they used to default to 'norm')
-CHANGED import of visual stimuli. They were imported into
base psychopy namespace, but are now in psychopy.visual
-OPTIMISED textures in AlphaStim to draw faster. 1D textures are
used where possible (inbuilts and 1D images)

PsychoPy 0.10
-ADDED calibration code (calib.py) - communication with PR650 
and gamma correction
-ADDED TrialHandler to help choosing next stimulus
-Renamed base package to psychopy, from psycho. (Was getting 
annoyed with other packages e.g. 'PIL' importing as 'Image')

PsychoPy 0.09
-fixed bug in drawing of dots. They were being centred in the 
wrong place in the window.
-set the range of RGB guns to be -1:1 throughout (was 0:1 for 
the window, -1:1 for stimuli)
-wrote an improved version of the setup.py script (based on 
that for chaco)

PsychoPy 0.08
-Reworked the scope of variables (no more "from xx import * "). 
Should have minimal effect on users except that they may want 
to import things to the root scope themselves.
-Created distutils setup script and added windows binary.

PsychoPy 0.07
-ADDED DotStim()
-Changed names of classes to have uppercsae first letters and 
functions/methods to have lowercase first letter so you now 
tell the difference (this will break previous code). Updated 
docs.

PsychoPy 0.06 
-Changed window parameter "type" to be "winType" because "type" 
is a built-in keyword of Python (oops!) updated docs to 
reflect changes

PsychoPy 0.05
-Added real world units - can now specify stimuli in degrees or 
cm as well as pixels or window ratio (if you give the monitor
dimensions and distance, obviously!)
