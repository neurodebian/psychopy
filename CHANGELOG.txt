!!Version numbers
In general, when a new feature is added the first or the second number is incremented (e.g. 0.90.3 -> 0.91.0). Those releases might break previous code you've written because new features often need slight changes to other things. 
Changes to the final digit (0.92.1 -> 0.92.2) implies a bug-fixing release or very minor new features that shouldn't require code changes form the user.
