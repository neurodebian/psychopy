PsychoPy is an open-source application allowing you run a wide range of neuroscience, psychology and psychophysics experiments. It's a free, powerful alternative to Presentation |TM| or e-Prime |TM|, written in Python (a free alternative to Matlab |TM| ).

PsychoPy is unique in giving you a choice of interface: use the **Builder interface** to build rich, flexible experiments easily or use the **Coder interface** to write extremely powerful experiments in the widely-used Python programming language. The best of both worlds!

====================

**PsychoPy is going Professional and Online!**

We're delighted to announce that `The Wellcome Trust <http://www.wellcome.ac.uk>`_ has granted us a sum of money that will allow us to hire a full-time developer, meaning that we will become more professional than ever and, critically, also funding for `Ilixa Ltd. <http://www.ilixa.com>`_ to complete the job of building the online experiment system that many of you have been waiting for! See the `discourse post <https://discourse.psychopy.org/t/wellcome-trust-funding-psychopy-is-going-properly-online/>`_ for further details of what we're planning.

**Latest version**: 1.85.3 was released August 2017 with initial proof-of-concept of online experiments. Beware - these are bound to be buggy so only use if you know what you're doing. And :ref:`READ THE DOCS <online>`. See the full :doc:`changelog`
