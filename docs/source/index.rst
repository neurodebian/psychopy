News
====================

**Latest version**: 1.83.04 was released Feb 2016. See the full :doc:`changelog`

We've got a new Movie engine!! Rejoice! MovieStim3 (built on the `moviepy <zulko.github.io/moviepy/>`_
package) seems more robust and doesn't require `avbin` or `vlc` to be installed separately.
In fact, if you don't have the necessary libs it should go and fetch the right one for you!
