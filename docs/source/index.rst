PsychoPy is an open-source application to allow the presentation of stimuli and collection of data for a wide range of neuroscience, psychology and psychophysics experiments. It's a free, powerful alternative to Presentation |TM| or e-Prime |TM|, written in Python (a free alternative to Matlab |TM| ).

News
====================

**Latest stable version**: 1.77.02 was released July 2013, with several performance improvements. See complete :doc:`changelog`

**Cutting edge version**: 1.78.00 was released Aug 2013. Adds :ref:`static` to allow pre-loading of images, and Shape Component for standard geometric shapes

**Upcoming Workshops**:
        
    :ref:`P4N`
    
        There will be a 3-day Python Workshop in April 2014 at Nottingham University, with **novice** and **intermediate** streams. We'll follow that with 2 days of a 'code sprint' for developers of PsychoPy. Limited spaces, so book now at `Nottingham's online store <http://store.nottingham.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&catid=49&prodid=323>`_.
